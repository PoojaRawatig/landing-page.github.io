            <h1>education, discipline that is concerned with methods of teaching and learning in schools </h1>
            <p>Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. There are<br> many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to<br> achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change <br>in the student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical <br>thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination.</p>

        <h2>Education in primitive and early civilized cultures</h2>
        <p>The term education can be applied to primitive cultures only in the sense of enculturation, <br>which is the process of cultural transmission.

                <h3 class="lightertext"> Education refers to the discipline that is concerned with methods of teaching and learning in schools or school-like environments,</h3>
                <p>Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and accumulated knowledge of a society. In this sense, it is equivalent to what social scientists term socialization or enculturation. Children—whether conceived among New Guinea tribespeople, the Renaissance Florentines, or the middle classes of Manhattan—are born without culture. Education is designed to guide them in learning a culture, molding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood, and directing them toward their eventual role in society. In the most primitive cultures, there is often little formal learning—little of what one would ordinarily call school or classes or teachers. Instead, the entire environment and all activities are frequently viewed as school and classes, and many or all adults act as teachers.</p>
